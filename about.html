            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <img src="./assets/RunnerProfile.png" alt="Profile picture of the Loopify creator" class="profile-img">
            <p>Hi there! I'm the Evyn the creator of Loopify, and I'm excited to share my interests for running and
                technology with you.</p>

            <h2>Running Journey</h2>
            <p>First and foremost, this achievement wouldnâ€™t have been possible without Coach Lindberg. Her countless
                hours of dedication, addressing both our physical and emotional needs, were vital in supporting our team
                and keeping us dedicated throughout the season of Cross-Country.</p>

            <h2>The creation of Loopify</h2>
            <p>During my running journey, I often found myself struggling to create diverse and interesting routes,
                especially when training for longer distances. I yearned for a tool that could effortlessly generate
                loop routes based on my desired distance, taking the guesswork out of route planning. This was the
                driving factor in creating Loopify. I wanted to create a solution that would not only help me but also
                benefit the entire running community. Loopify is the result of combining my passion for running with my
                skills in programming.</p>

            <h2>For those who are interested in the programming behind Loopify</h2>
            <p>First, it is important to understand that the data behind roads is represented as a <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory">graph</a>. Where <a href="">nodes</a> represent
                turning points in a road, and <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_graph_theory#edge">edges</a> are the line segment
                connecting the nodes. This is a
                good way to
                represent the information because it is easy to manipulate and store the data.</p>

            <p>There are a number of algorithms and systems behind this Loopify. For example, rendering things without
                causing too much latency. To combat this issue, I made sure to only load objects such as bathrooms,
                traffic lights, and <a href="">nodes</a> & <a href="">edges</a> at a given zoom based on the users
                bounds. </p>

            <p>Another would be the interaction with the map. After detecting map clicks, it needs to locate a point on
                a road (Road Snapping). To do this, I iterate through all the edges and find the start and end node.
                Then, you want to calculate where the point is closest to on an edge (node to node connection). To do
                this, you can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_projection">vector projection</a>. </p>
